**Generate statistically realistic synthetic patient cohorts (FHIR/CSV) from a schema spec for dev and testing..**

*Healthcare & Life-Sciences — HIPAA, PHI, FHIR/HL7, and clinical data.*

## Why

SYNTHCOHORT exists for one job — generate statistically realistic synthetic patient cohorts (fhir/csv) from a schema spec for dev and testing. — and does it without a SaaS bill or heavyweight setup.
Single-purpose, scriptable, CI-friendly, self-hostable, and callable by AI agents over MCP.

## Install

```bash
pip install cognis-synthcohort
# or from this repo:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick start

```bash
synthcohort --version
synthcohort scan .                      # scan the current project
synthcohort scan . --format json
synthcohort scan . --fail-on high       # non-zero exit for CI gates
synthcohort mcp                         # expose as an MCP server (Cognis.Studio / Claude Desktop / Cursor)
```

## Inspiration / prior art

Built in the spirit of **Synthea + Faker**, re-framed for the Cognis approach: single-purpose, self-hostable,
MCP-native, and unified with the rest of the Suite. Missing a credit? Open a PR.

## How it fits the Cognis Neural Suite

`synthcohort` is one of the **100+ tools** in the [Cognis Neural Suite](https://github.com/cognis-digital).
Every tool ships an MCP server, so [Cognis.Studio](https://cognis.studio) agents can call them as scoped capabilities.
